\<FONT CLASS=\"title\"\>TODO: Presents\</FONT\>

\<QUERY\>PROJECT STATUS\</QUERY\> BETA

\<QUERY\>STATUS NOTES\</QUERY\>

**This library has now been divided into two libs, for the sake of the
rumour system, and thus now depends on [the asking
library](NIPLibRefAsking).**

Test on S7 in place. Awaiting parser upgrade for Marrach. Also, command
will remain +ask until the rumours feature has been implemented as well.

\<QUERY\>WHAT?\</QUERY\> Presents, i.e. NPC ability to offer things to
PC\'s.

\<QUERY\>PRIORITY\</QUERY\> HIGH

\<QUERY\>ETA?\</QUERY\> Completed.

\<QUERY\>HOW WILL IT WORK?\</QUERY\> This system will work exactly like
[offers](NIPLibRefOffers) do currently, except backwards if you will.

Offers is used to make NPC\'s accept certain things, while presents is
used to enable NPC\'s ability to hand things out (using the \'ask\'
command). Like \'ask courier for scroll\'.

\<QUERY\>GENERAL DESCRIPTION\</QUERY\>

Self-explanatory.

\<QUERY\>LIBRARIES\</QUERY\>

    [Library]         [Description]
    presents            General 'presents' library.

\<QUERY\>TECHNICAL COMMENTS\</QUERY\>

The code will use the \'ask\' verb. The developer version for this will
be called +ask and will be developed on S7 (or will be started there,
unless the parser upgrade needed for raw verbs is transferred over).

This requires some amount of subtleness as we can\'t rip the current ask
functionality out until we have -all- such NPC\'s ready to be replaced.
