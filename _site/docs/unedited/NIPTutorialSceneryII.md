\<FONT CLASS=\"title\"\>Example scenes, situations and
conditions.\</FONT\>

**Introduction**

As you perhaps saw in [the previous tutorial](NIPTutorialScenery), the
conditional behavior can be roughly divided into scenes, and the scenes
can be divided into scene conditions, and scene situations.

Let\'s define those three aspects before we move on:

\* **A scene:**\<br\>A set up of conditions, with a variety of
conditions, each condition with explicit behavior data. E.g. \"commoner
NPC meeting lord or lady\" \* **A condition:**\<br\>A condition is an
external object, with a symbolic name, which defines a scene. E.g.
\"noble\" \* **A situation:**\<br\>A situation is added onto the
conditions of a scene, and defines the scene\'s current situation. E.g.
\"REVERENT\" or \"INDIFFERENT\" could be in our case used depending on
the type of commoner NPC.
