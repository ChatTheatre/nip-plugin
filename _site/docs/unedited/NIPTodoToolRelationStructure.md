\<font class=\"query\"\>WHAT?\</font\> A +NIP-tool to create/manipulate
relations structure data for NPC\'s.

\<font class=\"query\"\>PRIORITY\</font\> HIGH.

\<font class=\"query\"\>ETA?\</font\> Unknown.

\<font class=\"query\"\>HOW WILL IT WORK?\</font\>

The relations structure tool will be managed through the use of
Popup()\'s, and will contain a number of pages for each section of the
structure; such as **relation types**, **relation verbs**/**adverbs**,
and **relation detail modifiers**.

\<font class=\"query\"\>GENERAL DESCRIPTION\</font\>

The relations structure data is the rules mapped up for one or several
NPC\'s. It is used to determine the types of relationships an NPC can
enter into with those in its environment; it is used to determine the
meaning of actions performed by those, and to classify everyone
according to how they act in the NPC\'s presence. This data is much too
complicated to write without some form of tool.

\<font class=\"query\"\>TECHNICAL COMMENTS\</font\>
